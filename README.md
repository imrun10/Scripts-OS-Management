    - Replies with the msg received from script B or C.
- Script B should be a client which:
    - Sends the following msg to the server: “This is Client B.”
    - Prints the reply received from Script A.
- Script C should be a client which:
    - Sends the following msg to the server: “I am Client C.”
    - Prints the reply received from Script A.

## 4. Fourth Script:
- Creates two threads (Thread A, Thread B).
